    <h1>Child Labour: A Crime Against Childhood</h1>
    <p>
      Millions of children are forced to work in silence—while their right to learn, play, and grow is taken away.
      Awareness is the first step. Responsibility is the next.
    </p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>What Is Child Labour?</h2>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p>
      Child labour refers to the employment of children in work that deprives them of their childhood, education,
      health, and dignity. It includes work that is physically, mentally, or morally harmful and interferes with a
      child’s right to attend school and develop fully.
    </p>
    <p>
      When children are forced to work due to poverty or exploitation, and when that work replaces education,
      it becomes a serious violation of human rights. The consequences of child labour are long-term and affect
      the overall development of society, as these children often grow up without the skills or opportunities to
      break the cycle of poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Child labour is not limited to a single type of work; it ranges from hazardous factory work and domestic servitude
      to street vending and agricultural labour. Understanding the many forms it takes is essential to tackling it effectively.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Does Child Labour Exist?</h2>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <div class="cards">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Poverty</h3>
        <p>Families struggling to meet basic needs often depend on children’s income for survival. The lack of financial stability forces many parents to make difficult decisions, putting children into labour instead of school.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Lack of Education</h3>
        <p>When education is inaccessible, unaffordable, or undervalued, children are pushed into work. Quality schools, trained teachers, and affordable schooling are critical solutions.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Social Inequality</h3>
        <p>Marginalised communities face discrimination and limited opportunities, making children in these groups more vulnerable to exploitation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Weak Enforcement</h3>
        <p>Laws exist, but weak enforcement and corruption allow child labour to persist. Strong monitoring, reporting mechanisms, and strict penalties are needed.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Poor Awareness</h3>
        <p>Many families are unaware of their children's rights or the long-term harm of child labour. Community education campaigns can change mindsets.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Exploitation by Employers</h3>
        <p>Some businesses exploit children because they are cheap labor. Encouraging ethical business practices and certifications can reduce this problem.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Real Lives Behind the Issue</h2>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p>
      Behind every statistic is a real child whose life has been shaped by circumstances beyond their control.
      In <em>Lost Spring</em> by Anees Jung, children like Saheb and Mukesh reveal the human face of child labour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saheb survives by ragpicking, his childhood lost to survival. Mukesh works in hazardous conditions yet
      dreams of becoming a motor mechanic—representing a quiet hope for change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every child has potential, but child labour strips them of opportunities to develop talents, skills, and education.
      Stories like these highlight the urgency for immediate action and long-term solutions.
